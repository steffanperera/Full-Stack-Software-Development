A collection of concepts, exercises, and project examples centered on full-stack application development using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). This repository serves as a research and progress archive, documenting the learning journey across frontend and backend development, API design, database integration, and deployment workflows. It aims to consolidate knowledge and hands-on practice with modern full-stack technologies for educational and reference purposes.
